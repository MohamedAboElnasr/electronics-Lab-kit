# Electronics-Lab-kit

Hello There!

This is our project that we have made for our subject in college it's made by Enigma Team, and we are going to demonstrate every part of it.

First of all the project is about a kit that is used in many labs for electronics and circuits testing it has the following capabilities :

- <a href="#power-supply">Power Supply</a>
- <a href =#component-tester> Component Tester&PWM</a>
- <a href="#function-generator"> Function Generator</a>
- <a href="#logic-probe">Logic Probe</a> 
- <a href="#Volt-Meter">Volt and Current Measuring </a>
- <a href="#Final-Project"> Final Project</a>
<br>
<br>

## <p id="power-supply"> Power Supply </p>
First we started to design the Power supply circuit on proteus it has been designed to produce various types of voltage like +5v,-9v and 1.3v  up to 27v of postive and negative values, by using different types Regulators and LM amplifier.

Here is a list of all the specification:
 
- 5V +
- 5V -
- 9V +
- 9V -
- 12 +
- 12 -
- 0 To 24 V - or +

and this is the Sechematic and the 3D Modulation of the circuit

## <p id="component-tester">Component Tester & PWM </p>

This part of the kit is able to Test the Component of our circuit, it can give us the name or the value of the components like Resistors or Capacitors and also Transistors,it's made by an arduino nano and lcd screen to display the information about the component we are testing.

 ## <p id="function-generator">Function Generator </p>
 
 Function Generator is the part of the kit that is responsbale for producing different types of waves, we used the XR2206 IC for making sine,Triangle and Square waves 

 The circuit has the following specification:
 
* 1Hz – 10Hz
* 10Hz – 100Hz
* 100Hz – 3kHz
* 3kHz – 65kHz
* 65kHz – 1MHz
